#### Description 
This is the 80% AR-15 Lower Receiver Milling Jig by CTRL+Pew. This is a self-aligning jig which allows one to finish 80% lowers from a variety of manufacturers using only a drill press and a few common tools.

Mill following the instructions from SpecSheets/Jig_Manual_80_Percent_Arms.rev1.1S.doc.pdf skipping the drilling step since i didnt make a drilling plate.
