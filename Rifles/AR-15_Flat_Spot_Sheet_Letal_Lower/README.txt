This is a set of models I drew based on the sheet metal AR15 lower receiver kit from Jack's Flat Spot in 2013. 

The 2D drwaings are scalled 1:1 on 8.5"x11" paper with dimensions for proper scalling.

Most of this was done with calipers so the parts may not be perfectly accurate. 

I never modeled the gusset for the buffer tower because I couldn't constrain it in the assembly well.

Also included are models from cncguns.com that I used to check for fitment, along with a couple lightweight designs I messed around with.
