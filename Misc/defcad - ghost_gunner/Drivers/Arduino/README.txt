The Arduino driver is required to connect to Ghost Gunner.  DDcut should automatically install this driver, but you may need to manually install it if Ghost Gunner isn't showing up in DDcut.  To install, click install.bat, which will add the core driver components required to operate Ghost Gunner.

A restart may be required before Ghost Gunner will appear in DDcut.exe.
