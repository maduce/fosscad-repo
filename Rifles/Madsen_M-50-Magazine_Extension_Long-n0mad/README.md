#### Description
This is a two part magazine extension for madsen m50 magazines.

#### Test Record
This was tested on with a madsen m50 submachine gun.  As of version 8 it feeds and runs when loaded up to 49 rounds (+17).

#### Printing
* All printed parts were printed out of PETG, with an infill of 25%. Abs should also work.
* No support material needed
* Print both pieces on their backs to preven the need of infill.
* Print barrel standing on it rear end. 

#### Finishing
* Aquire six bolts of the appropriate diameter and length. I used chicago screws and bolts for a cleaner finish. 
* Drill out holes to fit bolt size. 
* A longer magazine spring will be required. This extension should work with extended glock springs. 
* I used the one found here. https://taccom3g.com/product/taccom-spring-kits/ The bolts and chicago screws will also work.
* The existing follower will need to be removed and affixed the the glock spring. 
* Clamp around magazine bolt down, no floor plate needed.
