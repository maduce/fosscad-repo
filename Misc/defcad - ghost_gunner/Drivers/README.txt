If no COM port is available when Choose Ghost is selected in DDCut, run ‘install.bat’ found in \Drivers\Arduino\ to manually install drivers necessary for your computer to detect your Ghost Gunner 2. 
 
Firmware/ Arduino/ contains the hardware drivers required to find Ghost Gunner.  Don't change the relative file path to DDcut.  DDcut should automatically install these drivers if they aren't installed already.  
If you're not able to connect to Ghost Gunner, see the README in the /Arduino folder.  Otherwise you don't need to mess around in this folder.

\AVRdude is required by DDcut to update the firmware.  Don't change the relative file path to DDcut.  You don't need to mess around in this folder.
