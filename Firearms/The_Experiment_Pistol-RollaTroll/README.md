# The Experiment

#### Version 

1.1

#### Description 

The Experiment pistol by RollaTroll.  This is a revision of The Experiment to version 1.1. It includes:  

* Stronger, wider trigger.  
* Fixed hole in hammer slide.  
* Added necessary cutout from underside of hammer slide to allow for cocking and firing (was completely useless otherwise).  
* Small gaps (.5mm) on moving parts to avoid friction.

It uses a few rubber bands for pulling the hammer slider and a nail of the appropriate size (just use the one you may have used for the Liberator).  This is my first origninal design of anything so just try it and see if it works. I would appreciate your feedback.  I made it over the course of 3 days, so if there is something wrong with it (and I'm sure there is), just tell me and I'll try to fix it (or you can do it yourself if you like). 

#### Instructions

You will need to print 5 standard pins and 1 of everything else. You will also need a few rubberbands for pulling the hammer slider and a nail of the apropriate size (just use the one you may have used for the Liberator).  Assemble it, put an appropriate nail in the hammer body, then put in the Firing Pin Bushing in behind it and stretch a couple rubber bands from the hooks at the front of the frame to the long hammer slider pins.  Insert a .380 cartridge into the barrel. The locking mechanism works by you inserting the pins into the holes and twisting counterclockwise. Once done it should be secure. To cock it, pull the hammer slide back and down. Then pull the trigger (from a distance) to fire.

#### Disclaimer 
I have designed this to the best of my ability, but do not hold me responsible for anything that this is used for or is the result of. I have not actually printed these parts, but they should work. You can try diffent thing so make them work (eg. sanding of a small amount of the pins) If you have any problems constructing it, just have a look at the assembled model. 


Best of luck!
