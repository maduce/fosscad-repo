#### Description
This is a two part magazine extension for madsen m50 magazines.

#### Test Record
This was tested on with a madsen m50 submachine gun.  As of version 8 it feeds and runs when loaded up to 40 rounds (+8 rounds).

#### Printing
* All printed parts were printed out of PETG, with an infill of 25%. Abs should also work.
* No support material needed.
* Print both pieces on their back to prevent the use of supports.

#### Finishing
* Aquire four bolts of the appropriate diameter and length. I used chicago screws and bolts for a cleaner finish. 
* Drill out holes to fit bolt size. 
* Existing factory springs will work.
* Clamp around magazine bolt down, no floor plate needed.
